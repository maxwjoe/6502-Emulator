# 6502-Emulator

### About
The 6502 processor was one of the first low cost consumer processors. It could be found in devices such as the Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Commodore 64, and many others. The goal of this project is to emulate this CPU to gain both an appreciation and understanding of low level computing. 

### Goals
1. All CPU Instructions Emulated 
2. Parse 6502 Assembly instruction to a virtual ROM for execution
3. Execute a hello world program
